# Vapi GitOps

Manage Vapi resources (Assistants, Structured Outputs, and Tools) via Git using YAML as the source-of-truth.

## Why GitOps?

| | Dashboard / Ad-hoc API | GitOps |
|---|---|---|
| **History** | Limited visibility of who changed what | Full git history with blame |
| **Review** | Changes go live immediately (can break things) | PR review before deploy |
| **Rollback** | Manual recreation | `git revert` + apply |
| **Environments** | Tedious to copy-paste between envs | Same config, different state files |
| **Collaboration** | One person at a time. Need to duplicate assistants, tools, etc. | Team can collaborate and use git branching |
| **Reproducibility** | "It worked on my assistant!" | Declarative, version-controlled |
| **Disaster Recovery** | Hope you have backups | Re-apply from git |

### Key Benefits

- **Audit Trail** — Every change is a commit with author, timestamp, and reason
- **Code Review** — Catch misconfigurations before they hit production
- **Environment Parity** — Dev, staging, and prod stay in sync
- **No Drift** — Git is the truth; manual console changes get overwritten
- **Automation Ready** — Plug into CI/CD pipelines

### Supported Resources

> ⚠️ **Note:** This project currently supports:
> - ✅ Assistants
> - ✅ Tools
> - ✅ Structured Outputs
>
> Want to manage other Vapi resources? The codebase is designed to be extensible.
> Add support for **Squads**, **Phone Numbers**, **Files**, **Knowledge Bases**, and more
> by following the patterns in `src/`.

## Quick Start

## How-To Guides

### How to Add a New Tool

**Step 1:** Create a new YAML file in `resources/tools/`

```bash
touch resources/tools/my-new-tool.yml
```

**Step 2:** Define the tool configuration

```yaml
# resources/tools/my-new-tool.yml
type: function
function:
  name: get_weather
  description: Get the current weather for a location
  parameters:
    type: object
    properties:
      location:
        type: string
        description: The city name
    required:
      - location
server:
  url: https://my-api.com/weather
```

**Step 3:** Apply the changes

```bash
bun run apply:dev
```

The tool will be created and its UUID saved to `.vapi-state.dev.json`.

---

### How to Attach a Tool to an Assistant

**Step 1:** Note the tool's filename (without extension) - this is its resource ID

```
resources/tools/my-new-tool.yml  →  resource ID: "my-new-tool"
```

**Step 2:** Edit your assistant YAML and add the tool reference

```yaml
# resources/assistants/my-assistant.yml
name: My Assistant
model:
  provider: openai
  model: gpt-4o
  messages:
    - role: system
      content: You are a helpful assistant.
  toolIds:
    - my-new-tool    # ← Reference by filename (without .yml)
    - transfer-call  # ← You can add multiple tools
firstMessage: Hello! How can I help you?
```

**Step 3:** Apply the changes

```bash
bun run apply:dev
```

The apply engine will:
1. Create/update the tool first
2. Resolve `my-new-tool` → actual Vapi UUID
3. Create/update the assistant with the resolved UUID

---

### How to Add a Structured Output to an Assistant

**Step 1:** Create a structured output in `resources/structuredOutputs/`

```yaml
# resources/structuredOutputs/call-summary.yml
name: Call Summary
type: ai
description: Summarizes the key points of a call
schema:
  type: object
  properties:
    summary:
      type: string
      description: Brief summary of the call
    sentiment:
      type: string
      enum: [positive, neutral, negative]
    actionItems:
      type: array
      items:
        type: string
model:
  provider: openai
  model: gpt-4o
assistant_ids:
  - my-assistant  # ← Links to the assistant
workflow_ids: []
```

**Step 2:** Reference it in your assistant's artifact plan

```yaml
# resources/assistants/my-assistant.yml
name: My Assistant
model:
  provider: openai
  model: gpt-4o
  # ... other config
artifactPlan:
  structuredOutputIds:
    - call-summary  # ← Reference by filename
```

**Step 3:** Apply

```bash
bun run apply:dev
```

---

### How to Delete a Resource

**Step 1:** Remove any references to the resource first

If deleting a tool, remove it from all assistants' `toolIds`:

```yaml
# Before - resources/assistants/my-assistant.yml
model:
  toolIds:
    - transfer-call
    - my-tool-to-delete  # ← Remove this line

# After
model:
  toolIds:
    - transfer-call
```

**Step 2:** Delete the resource file

```bash
rm resources/tools/my-tool-to-delete.yml
```

**Step 3:** Apply

```bash
bun run apply:dev
```

The apply engine will:
1. Detect the resource is in state but not in filesystem
2. Check for orphan references (will error if still referenced)
3. Delete the resource from Vapi
4. Remove it from the state file

> ⚠️ **Important**: If you try to delete a resource that's still referenced, you'll get an error like:
> ```
> Cannot delete tool "my-tool" - still referenced by: assistants/my-assistant
> ```

---

### How to Rename a Resource

Renaming requires deleting the old and creating a new resource.

**Step 1:** Update all references to use the new name

```yaml
# resources/assistants/my-assistant.yml
model:
  toolIds:
    - new-tool-name  # ← Update to new name
```

**Step 2:** Rename the file

```bash
mv resources/tools/old-tool-name.yml resources/tools/new-tool-name.yml
```

**Step 3:** Apply

```bash
bun run apply:dev
```

This will:
1. Delete the old resource (old-tool-name)
2. Create the new resource (new-tool-name)
3. Update state file with new mapping

### How to Promote Changes Between Environments

**Step 1:** Test in dev first

```bash
bun run apply:dev
```

**Step 2:** Verify everything works, then apply to prod

```bash
bun run apply:prod
```

Each environment has its own:
- `.env.{env}` - API token
- `.vapi-state.{env}.json` - Resource UUID mappings

---

### How to Add a New Environment

Example: Adding a `staging` environment.

**Step 1:** Add the environment to the valid environments list

Edit `src/types.ts`:

```typescript
export type Environment = "dev" | "staging" | "prod";

export const VALID_ENVIRONMENTS: readonly Environment[] = ["dev", "staging", "prod"];
```

**Step 2:** Add a new npm script

Edit `package.json`:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "apply:dev": "bun run apply.ts dev",
    "apply:staging": "bun run apply.ts staging",
    "apply:prod": "bun run apply.ts prod"
  }
}
```

**Step 3:** Create the environment secrets file

```bash
echo "VAPI_TOKEN=your-staging-token" > .env.staging
```

**Step 4:** Initialize the state file (optional - created automatically on first run)

```bash
echo '{"assistants":{},"structuredOutputs":{},"tools":{}}' > .vapi-state.staging.json
```

**Step 5:** Apply to the new environment

```bash
bun run apply:staging
```

This creates all resources in the staging Vapi account and populates `.vapi-state.staging.json` with the new UUIDs.

### How to Add Comments to YAML References

You can add inline comments to document references:

```yaml
model:
  toolIds:
    - transfer-call ## Transfers to human support
    - get-weather   ## Fetches weather data from API
artifactPlan:
  structuredOutputIds:
    - call-summary  ## Generated at end of each call
```

The apply engine strips everything after `##` when resolving references.

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `VAPI_TOKEN` | ✅ | API authentication token |
| `VAPI_BASE_URL` | ❌ | API base URL (defaults to `https://api.vapi.ai`) |

### Update Exclusions

Some properties can't be sent during updates. Configure in `src/config.ts`:

```typescript
export const UPDATE_EXCLUDED_KEYS: Record<ResourceType, string[]> = {
  tools: ["type"],           // 'type' can't be changed after creation
  assistants: [],
  structuredOutputs: ["type"],
};
```

---

## State Files

State files track the mapping between resource IDs and Vapi UUIDs:

```json
{
  "assistants": {
    "my-assistant": "uuid-1234-5678"
  },
  "structuredOutputs": {
    "call-summary": "uuid-abcd-efgh"
  },
  "tools": {
    "transfer-call": "uuid-wxyz-1234"
  }
}
```

---

## How the Apply Engine Works

1. Load resource files from `/resources`
2. Load environment-specific state file
3. **Delete** orphaned resources (in state but not in filesystem)
4. For each resource:
   - If resource ID exists in state → **UPDATE** using stored UUID
   - If not → **CREATE** new resource, save UUID to state
5. Resolve cross-references (tool IDs → UUIDs)
6. Save updated state file

### Processing Order

**Deletions** (reverse dependency order):
1. Assistants → 2. Structured Outputs → 3. Tools

**Creates/Updates** (dependency order):
1. Tools → 2. Structured Outputs → 3. Assistants → 4. Link outputs to assistants

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Reference not found" warnings

The resource you're referencing doesn't exist yet. Make sure:
1. The referenced file exists in the correct folder
2. The filename matches exactly (case-sensitive)
3. You're using the filename without the `.yml` extension

### "Cannot delete resource - still referenced"

Remove the reference from other resources before deleting:
1. Find which resources reference it (shown in error message)
2. Edit those files to remove the reference
3. Apply again
4. Then delete the resource file

### "property X should not exist" API errors

Some properties can't be updated after creation. Add them to `UPDATE_EXCLUDED_KEYS` in `src/config.ts`.

### Resource not updating

Check the state file has the correct UUID:
1. Open `.vapi-state.{env}.json`
2. Find the resource entry
3. If incorrect, delete the entry and re-run apply
