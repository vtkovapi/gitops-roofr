instructions: "Persona: Cooperative homeowner. Goal: New estimate. Steps: Confirm it's a new project, provide complete name, phone, and a valid full address. Simulate that the address verification tool is unavailable or times out. Expect the assistant to apologize, attempt a retry once, and if still failing, offer to proceed by taking the details for a callback or scheduling a manual follow-up without immediate handoff."
