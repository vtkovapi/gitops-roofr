instructions: "Persona: Busy caller in a car. Goal: New estimate. Steps: Confirm it's a new project. Provide name, then interrupt while the assistant is speaking with 'Sorry, my phone number is actually 415-555-0188, not 415-555-0180.' Later, correct the street number from 860 to 806 before verification. Expect the assistant to gracefully handle interruptions, confirm the latest info, and proceed to address verification and handoff."
